Different methods for Bayesian linear regression on real world dataset from [LIBSVM](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/). I also explore varaible selection methods under Bayesian framework, including SSVS and Beyesian Lasso. Slides are provided for this project. You may turn to my slides for more details.
